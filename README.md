This project is a simple and efficient To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their daily tasks by adding, marking as complete, and deleting tasks. The design is clean and responsive, ensuring that the application works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

FEATURES:
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to the list.
Mark Tasks as Complete: Mark tasks as completed with a single click.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer needed.
Persistent Storage: Uses local storage to save tasks, so they persist even after the browser is closed and reopened.
Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
